Elements I frequently forget and have to look up


## geom_point with categorical X-axis

To get some jitter so that not all points are on a line:
`geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2))`

To add error bars on the point plot:
```
plot +
stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point", fill= "red") +
stat_summary(fun.data = mean_sdl, mult = 1, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.2, col = "red")
```
