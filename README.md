# Basic info on this repo

This repo exists for me to store my bookmarks of tutorials/blog posts and my course notes. With this repo, I intent to store my summaries/cheat sheets of courses taken, and to bookmark some tutorials and blog posts I found of others.  

The main audience for this repo is future me, and to make sure I can access it from anywhere super easily. But you never know it helps out others, which is why I decided to make it publicly available on GitHub.
